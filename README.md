# <b> Requirement for running the code </b>

# <b> 1. Business Understanding </b>
## Background Problems
The campaign carried out by a retail company was less effective, as seen from the campaign response which only reached 14.91%. As a results, the profit obtained is not optimal.

## Goals and Objective
- Goals: Optimizing profits by creating more targeted marketing campaigns.
- Objective: Create machine learning models to predict customers who are most likely to receive certain promotions so as to make campaigns more targeted and get optimal profits
- Business Metrics : Profitability

## Scope
The model only can give the result whether customer responses the campaign or not, but cannot explain the reason behind the customer response

Machine learning Output : Customer response label from given customer characteristic
